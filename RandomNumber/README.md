5\. Random Number Frequencies

&nbsp;Write	a program that	generates	100	random	numbers	between	1	and	10.	The	program	

should store the frequency of each number generated in a dictionary with the number as 

the key and the amount of times it has occurred as the value. For example, if the program 

generates	the	number	6	a	total	of	11	times,	the	dictionary	will	contain	a	key	of	6	with	an	

associated	value	of	11.	Once	all	of	the	numbers	have	been	generated,	display	information	

about the frequency of each number
