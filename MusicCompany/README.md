Hal owns a business named Make Your Own Music, which sells guitars, drums, banjos, 
synthesizers, and many other musical instruments. Hal’s sales staff works strictly on commission. At the end of the month, each salesperson’s commission is calculated according to 
Table 5-1.
Table 5-1 Sales commission rates
Sales This Month Commission Rate
Less than $10,000 10%
$10,000–14,999 12%
$15,000–17,999 14%
$18,000–21,999 16%
$22,000 or more 18%
For example, a salesperson with $16,000 in monthly sales will earn a 14 percent commission ($2,240). Another salesperson with $18,000 in monthly sales will earn a 16 percent 
commission ($2,880). A person with $30,000 in sales will earn an 18 percent commission 
($5,400).
Because the staff gets paid once per month, Hal allows each employee to take up to 
$2,000 per month in advance. When sales commissions are calculated, the amount of each 
employee’s advanced pay is subtracted from the commission. If any salesperson’s commissions are less than the amount of their advance, they must reimburse Hal for the difference. 
To calculate a salesperson’s monthly pay, Hal uses the following formula:
pay 5 sales 3 commission rate 2 advanced pay
Hal has asked you to write a program that makes this calculation for him. The following 
general algorithm outlines the steps the program must take.
